# A Cross Between Etch-a-Sketch & Sketch Pad

## Overview

This etch-a-sketch/sketch pad gives you the opportunity to create a virtual painting by hovering their mouse over the grid. Here is a work of art I put together! :)

 You are able to change the dimension of the grid by clicking the RESET button, this will change the thickness of your paint. You also have the opportunity to change the paint color with two options:
* Selecting a single color
* Allowing color to randomly change (RGB)

## Reflection Log
### April 4th, 2022

Hello and welcome to the first public project of my journey to developing my skill in full-stack software development.

This project uses the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It takes advantage of DOM event listeners, DOM element creation and user input.

Future considerations include:
* Change the display to look for like a sketchpad
* Adding an option to stop painting without having to leave the grid
* Adding an option for change paint thickness
* Adding an option to erase - this will make it more like a sketch pad
* Adding an option to save the work of art
